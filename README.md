- Exception Handling (custom exceptions)
- File I/O operations
- JDBC connectivity
- JSON processing
- Multithreading
- XML processing
- Control flow and data types
- Strings and arrays

**Learning Outcomes:** Revised object-oriented programming principles, data structures, and Java APIs for file handling, database connectivity, and concurrent programming.

### 02 DBMS
**Topics Covered:**
- Database creation and management
- Table creation with constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- CRUD operations (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Aggregation functions
- Indexes and views

**Learning Outcomes:** Understood relational database design, SQL Server fundamentals, and data integrity through constraints and relationships.

### 03 Web
**Topics Covered:**
- HTML5 form elements and validation
- CSS styling
- JavaScript form validation
- Bootstrap framework integration
- Client-side interactivity

**Learning Outcomes:** Built responsive web forms with proper validation and UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 04 Application
**Topics Covered:**
- Servlet lifecycle and HTTP methods
- JSP (JavaServer Pages) fundamentals
- Session management
- User authentication (Login/Register functionality)
- Maven project structure
- Web application deployment (web.xml configuration)

**Learning Outcomes:** Developed server-side Java web applications using Servlets and JSP, implemented authentication flows, and implemented the request-response cycle.

### 05 Python
**Topics Covered:**
- Variables, constants, and data types
- Type conversion
- Control flow (if-else, loops)
- Functions (definition, parameters, return values)
- Error handling (try-except blocks)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- Integrated programming exercises

**Learning Outcomes:** Practiced python syntax, data manipulation, and problem-solving using Python's built-in data structures and control structures.
